Things that I choose to do:

- create a db to store the login and registration data
- use solution NuGet Packages for APIs: Microsoft SqlServer and Microsoft Tools )
- use password hashing for security to convert a password to ciphertext using hash algorithms.
- use password salting also for security to add random in the password prior to hashing
